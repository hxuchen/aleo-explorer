            <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
        </div>

        <p>
            I'm not a lawyer, so I'm not going to write a legal document here. I'm just going to tell you what I do
            with your data.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> When you use the explorer, your requests will appear in the web server logs
            (non-cached part){% if ("CLOUDFLARE" | get_env) or ("MATOMO" | get_env) %} or analytics data{% endif %},
            so there might be enough information to link different addresses together depending on your requests
            (searches, page visits, etc.) I will not use this information against anyone or give them to anyone else,
            nor will I actively collect and derive such information from various logs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Depending on the code configuration, this explorer might have different analytic scripts embedded on every
            page. Below are what's enabled on this explorer instance.
        </p>

    {% if "CLOUDFLARE" | get_env %}
        <h4>Cloudflare</h4>

        <p>
            This site uses Cloudflare to protect the server from attacks, so all web requests go through Cloudflare's
            CDN nodes before hitting this server. Cloudflare will collect data about those requests, so you should read
            their policies:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">Cloudflare's Privacy Policy</a> (You are "End Users" in this document)</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/cookie-policy/">Cloudflare's Cookie Policy</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I can access aggregated request data and individual security logs to identify possible attacks and act on them.
        </p>

        <p>
            This site also uses Cloudflare Analytics. I use the performance data and Core Web Vitals statistics to help
            me optimize the explorer.
        </p>
    {% endif %}

    {% if "MATOMO" | get_env %}
        <h4>Matomo Analytics (Self-hosted)</h4>

        <p>
            This site uses a self-hosted Matomo Analytics instance. It's an open-source alternative to Google Analytics
            and can collect more detailed info about your visits. As it's a self-hosted instance, only I can access the data.</p>

        <p>
            Matomo analytics can anonymize many data and is fully GDPR-compliant. I use this data to study how
            visitors interact with the site and make improvements.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can always opt out from being tracked by clicking the "Opt Out" link at the bottom of every page. You
            can also require me to delete all your data by sending a request email to privacy@hamp.app and include at
            least the first three segments of your IP address.
        </p>

            <em>There are no analytics scripts on this site.</em>

    {% endif %}
